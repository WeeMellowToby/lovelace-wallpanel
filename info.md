# Installation

* Search for `WallPanel` in the Home Assistant Community Store
* Click on the repository
* Click the `Download` button
* You can now select a special version if required
* Click on `Download`

{% endif %}

# Quick Start
Add a wallpanel configuration to your Home Assistant Dashboard configuration yaml (raw config).

* Click Overview in your sidebar.
* Click the three dots menu (top-right) and click on Edit Dashboard.
* Click the three dots menu again and click on Raw configuration editor.
* Add the `wallpanel` configuration above anything else.

```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  hide_toolbar: false
  hide_sidebar: true
  fullscreen: false
```

You can add a view that is displayed above the screensaver images.
Simply refer to an existing view of the dashboard by its title or path.
```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  cards: []
  views:
    - title: Wallpanel
```

Or add individual cards.
You can copy the cards yaml from the raw configuration of any dashboard.

```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: true
  views: []
  cards:
    - type: weather-forecast
      entity: weather.open_meteo_home
      forecast_type: daily
```

You can use [Browser Mod](https://github.com/thomasloven/hass-browser_mod) to activate WallPanel on individual devices only. Replace `<browser-id>` with the Browser ID from Browser Mod.

```yaml
wallpanel:
  enabled: false
  profiles:
    device.<browser-id>:
      enabled: true
```
